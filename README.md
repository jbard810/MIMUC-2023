# MIMUC-2023
Presentation Abstract:

This talk will describe, motivate, and explore one of the most important developments to risk management within quantitative finance: fortunes formula. Fortunes formula, or more formally known as the Kelly criterion, describes a way to size a position in face of a favorable edge (or a betting game with a positive expectation). For instance, one could use the Kelly criterion to size a position of an investment in a portfolio or a bet in gambling games. The talk will include motivation of the Kelly criterion with a simple binomial game of coin tossing, include a thorough quantitative and qualitative discussion of the importance of risk management, will describe the criterion along with notable historical influences, and finally make the criterion operational to participants with a discussion of the modelsâ€™ assumptions. Participants will also be left with a Jupyter Notebook that will enable them to implement the criterion on their own time with further resources to enrich their understanding of the criterion after the presentation.
